Assignment 3: Static Visualization in D3 (credit/no credit)
 
I created a stacked Area Chart using D3, Bootstrap, and Jquery displaying the my daily caloric intake and outake for the 
month of January. I sorted each day's calories by meal type: breakfast,lunch,dinner,and snack. I also included each day's 
calories burnt by exercise.
